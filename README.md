# MY-PYTHON-ADVENTURE-GAME

This is the  repository i created for the first udacity python tutorial project.

It contains one file called **_adventure_game.py_**. Inside the file are the python lines of codes
that made the game playable as directed by the udacity **intro to programming** course team .

Anyone interested can use it as a guide to implement his or her own adventure game.

**THANK YOU**
